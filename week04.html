        <ul>
          <li>Forms are a very common method of interacting with a web page. 
            A form is the main component of Google’s home page, and most of us use forms every day to log in to our favorite sites.</li>
       
      <li>Forms are made up of a <form> element that contains form controls such as input fields.</li>
        <li> This form has a name attribute of search, and contains two controls: an input field where a user can enter a search phrase, and a button to submit the form. </li>
          <li> The f orm.actio n property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so it’s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server:
          <br> eg: f orm.actio n = '/an/other.url'</li>
            <li> most important in forms is submit </li>
           <li><input> fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads <br>
             <sel ect> menus for drop-down lists of options <br>
               <tex tarea> elements for longer text entry <br>
                 <but ton> elements for submitting and resetting forms  </li>
                 
          <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods  </li>
            <li>All objects have a constructor property that returns the constructor function that created it:
                 <br>blueDice.constructor <br>
                  << [Function: Dice]
                 </li>
        
          <li>A mixin is a way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another object without using inheritance. It allows more complex objects to be created by ‘mixing’ basic objects together.  </li>
