      <div class="content">
       
        
        <ul>
          <li>An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions.
            They act as a collection of named properties that map to any JavaScript value such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and functions.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul> You can access the properties of an object using the dot notation that we’ve already seen in previous chapters.</ul>
        <ul> To call an object’s method we can also use dot or bracket notation. Calling a method is the same as
          invoking a function, so parentheses need to be placed after the method name:</ul>
        <ul>An important concept to get your head around is that objects are assigned by reference. This means that if a variable is assigned to an object 
          that already exists, it will simply point to the exact same space in memory. So any changes made using either reference will affect the same object.
          In the example below, we create a new object called thor to represent The Mighty Thor and make a copy of it called cloneThor
 </ul>
        <ul>JSON files(look into) </ul>
        <ul>What is the DOM? <br>
        The Document Object Model, or DOM for short, represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure
 </ul>
        <ul>Node objects have a number of properties and methods for navigating around the document tree. Once you have a reference to an element,
          you can walk along the document tree to find other nodes. Let's focus on a particular part of the document tree in our example </ul>
        <ul>Event listeners are added to elements on the page and are part of the DOM that we met in the last chapter. In the example above, the event listener has been added to the document’s
          body element. It will call the function doSomething() when any part of the page is clicked on. Until that happens, the program will continue to run the rest of the code. </ul>
