        </ul>
        <ul>In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be passed around in the same way as every other value. </ul>
        
        <ul>If a function doesn’t refer to an object as this in its body, it can still be called using the call () method, but you need 
          provide null as its first argument. For example, we could call the square () function using the call () method, like so:</ul>
      
        <ul>There is nothing to stop you adding your own properties to functions in the same way that you can add properties to any object
          in JavaScript. For example, you could add a description property to a function that describes what it doesThere is nothing to
          stop you adding your own properties to functions in the same way that you can add properties to any object in JavaScript. 
          For example, you could add a description property to a function that describes what it does</ul>

          <li>*AJAX notes <br>
          Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically 
            updates web pages without reloading. This enables data to be sent and received in the background, as well
            as portions of a page to be updated in response to user events, while the rest of the program continues to run.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul> The Fetch API introduced the Response interface that deals with the object that’s returned when the promise is fulfilled </ul>
        
        <ul>JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses.</ul>
