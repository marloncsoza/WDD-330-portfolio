        <ul>
          <li>Testing and Debugging</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><strong> Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following: </strong> <br>
            *System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.<br>
            *Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.<br>
            *User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle. <br> </ul>
        
        <ul> <strong>Exceptions</strong> An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. </ul>
      
        <ul><strong>Warnings</strong> A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning. 
          This might sound good, but it can be problematic, since the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to continue running incorrectly.
 </ul>
        <ul><strong>Tests</strong>Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on. </ul>
      
        <ul> <strong>Test-driven Development</strong> Also TDD. </ul>
        <ul>*Jest is a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently. It makes it easy to create and run tests by providing helper methods for
          common test assertions. </ul>

            <li>They say Jest is made by facebook, is it the same as meta? </li>
            <br>
            
            <li>As for the warning part, is it the red dots that usually shows on the left hand side of the screen?</li>
