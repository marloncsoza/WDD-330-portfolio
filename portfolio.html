<h2>Weekly Notes Folder</h2>
<p>I rate myself at about 87% over 100 because i have covered most of the requirements if not all of them. The reason why the other 10% is not there is because there is still room 
for improvemet as i feel of know that there are some thing i can still do. The reason for me making a rate SPA is because it cover the requiements and the things we've done
in the semester. It was a challenge to get it all going with fetch and also the link for the rates only last for 2 weeks before it required a change. the other 10% lacking to make this 
100% is truly not having enough time to decorate the portfolio the way i really wanten. Its in a form of folder to make it unique from everyones.</p>
